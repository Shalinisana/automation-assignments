Agile methodology:

 - It is used in big projects, so that project will be divided into modules and 
each module is divided into sprints and by using sprints project is implemented.

 -In agile we dont need too much documentation which is time consuming
 The process of agile methodology can be done quickly.

 The precursor for agile model is RAD (rapid application development model)

-It is prototyping and iterative model with no planning.
-RAD means building continuous evaluation requirements
-RAD model includes agile methodology and spiral model.
-RAD model is used only when project is divided into modules

 Phases of RAD are:

1.business modelling
2.data modelling
3.process modelling
4.application modelling
5.testing

Advantages:
 1.we can do changes in requirements by clients
 2.Quick process
 3.reviews by client in initial stage
 4.short time we can complete the project
 5.possibility of lesser defects

DisAdavantages:
 1.business requirements should be identify
 2.requires high skilled members in team
 3.user involvement throughout the project
 4.cannot be used for smaller projects

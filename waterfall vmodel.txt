Waterfall model:

	Waterfall model is a sequential model for developing small size or simple projects.
       Activities that are carried out one after another without going back is called waterfall model
Steps that are involved in waterfall are
	1.business Requirements
	2.system requirements
	3.design
	4.coding
	5.testing 
	6.delivery 
	maintance
Advantages:
	1.only when the requirements are very clear
	As requirements are clear chances of making mistakes are less
   	2.Documentation is done at every phase
	3.Testing will be done after development.
Disadvantages:
	1.defects can cause problems to entire project 
	2.difficult to go back and do changes
	3.no ambiguous requirements
	4.project should be short
	5.should go to another version if any problems or changes should be made.

V model:

	Suitable for small projects where requirements are complex.
	verification and validation is performed in V model which is in v shape
	to find defects at early stage testing can be done right from the requirements
Steps involved in V model are
  verification phase
	1.requirements
	2.system requirements
	3.high level design
	4.low level design
	5.code
  validation phase
	6.unit testing
	7.integration testing
	8.system testing
	9.acceptance testing
Advantages:
	1.simple and easy
	2.test plan should be created before development
	3.before the coding testing activites are done
	4.defects are found at early stage	
	
Disadvantages:
	1.if any changes happen both test documents and requirement documents should be changed.
	2.difficult to see problems at early stages
